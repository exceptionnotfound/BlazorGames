<h2>How To Make Tic Tac Toe in Blazor</h2>

<p>The source code for this sample is available <a href="https://github.com/exceptionnotfound/BlazorGames">over on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>
    As always when attempting to model a game, we first need to consider the kinds of items we will interact with.
    For tic-tac-toe this is fairly straightforward, as we only have the board itself and the x's and o's. 
</p>

<p>Game pieces in tic-tac-toe can only have one of two values: X or O. They can also be blank. Let's use a C# enumeration to define this:</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public enum PieceStyle
{
    X,
    O,
    Blank
}
</code></pre>

<p>We will also need a class for the GamePiece itself:</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GamePiece
{
    public PieceStyle Style;

    public GamePiece()
    {
        Style = PieceStyle.Blank;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can now begin to model the most important component of this example: the GameBoard class.</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //A 2D array of game pieces,
    //expected to blank at the beginning of the game.
    public GamePiece[,] Board { get; set; }

    public PieceStyle CurrentTurn = PieceStyle.X;

    public GameBoard()
    {
        Reset();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note the Reset() method. All that method does is set the game board back to blank spaces:</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Properties
    public void Reset()
    {
        Board = new GamePiece[3, 3];

        //Populate the Board with blank pieces
        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 2; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt;= 2; j++)
            {
                Board[i, j] = new GamePiece();
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we begin the real work, and consider this question: how do we model a game being played?</p>

<h3>Let's Take Turns</h3>

<p>
    In order to allow our system to simulate turn-taking, we need to track whose turn it currently is.
    To do that, we can introduce a property in our GameBoard class called CurrentTurn, and have it use
    a method named SwitchTurns():
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods

    public PieceStyle CurrentTurn = PieceStyle.X;

    private void SwitchTurns()
    {
        //This is equivalent to: if currently X's turn,
        // make it O's turn, and vice-versa
        CurrentTurn = CurrentTurn == PieceStyle.X ? PieceStyle.O : PieceStyle.X;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We also need a method that represents a turn being taken. 
    On a player's turn, they will click an empty space and place their marker (X or O) on that space. 
    However, they shouldn't be able to click any spaces in two conditions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The space is already occupied OR</li>
    <li>The game is complete</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's deal with the second condition first. We can use a new property to check if the game is complete:</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties

    public bool GameComplete => GetWinner() != null || IsADraw();

    //...Other Methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We will implement the methods GetWinner() and IsADraw() later. 
    The main thing to take away from this is that the game is complete when either a 
    winner is declared or a draw occurs.
</p>

<p>
    Now we can write a method to allow players to "claim" spaces, 
    which also includes a check to make sure that they aren't already claimed:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp">
<code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods

    //Given the coordinates of the space that was clicked...
    public void PieceClicked(int x, int y)
    {
        //If the game is complete, do nothing
        if (GameComplete) { return; }

        //If the space is not already claimed...
        GamePiece clickedSpace = Board[x, y];
        if (clickedSpace.Style == PieceStyle.Blank)
        {
            //Set the marker to the current turn marker (X or O)
            clickedSpace.Style = CurrentTurn;

            //Make it the other player's turn
            SwitchTurns();
        }
    }
}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>That's all the code we need for our tic-tac-toe players to take turns! Now let's deal with some other scenarios.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Draws</h3>

<p>
    NOTE: The code in this section and the next was originally submitted by 
    <a href="https://github.com/johnt84">John Tomlinson</a> and modified by me.
</p>

<p>
    It's possible (and if the players are older than five, likely) that a tic-tac-toe 
    game will end in a draw. A "draw" occurs when all spaces are occupied and no winner 
    can be found. So, let's create a method to watch for this situation.
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    public bool IsADraw()
    {
        int pieceBlankCount = 0;

        //Count all the blank spaces. If the count is 0, this is a draw.
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++)
            {
                pieceBlankCount = this.Board[i, j].Style == PieceStyle.Blank
                ? pieceBlankCount + 1
                : pieceBlankCount;
            }
        }

        return pieceBlankCount == 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Winning the Game</h3>

<p>
    Now we come to the most complex of the 
    scenarios we're going to be dealing with: 
    how do we determine if a game has been won?
</p>

<p>
    The method to check this is going to be brute-force: for each space on the board, check each possible 
    direction for matching pieces, and if you find three in a row, stop checking.
</p>

<p>
    First, let's implement an enumeration to show the directions from which we will look for tic-tac-toes:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public enum EvaluationDirection
{
    Up,
    UpRight,
    Right,
    DownRight
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The method to do this for a single given space looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods

    private WinningPlay EvaluatePieceForWinner(int i, int j,
                                               EvaluationDirection dir)
    {
        GamePiece currentPiece = Board[i, j];
        if (currentPiece.Style == PieceStyle.Blank)
        {
            return null;
        }

        int inARow = 1;
        int iNext = i;
        int jNext = j;

        var winningMoves = new List&lt;string&gt;();

        while (inARow &lt; 3)
        {
            //For each direction, increment the pointers to the next space
            //to be evaluated
            switch (dir)
            {
                case EvaluationDirection.Up:
                    jNext -= 1;
                    break;

                case EvaluationDirection.UpRight:
                    iNext += 1;
                    jNext -= 1;
                    break;

                case EvaluationDirection.Right:
                    iNext += 1;
                    break;

                case EvaluationDirection.DownRight:
                    iNext += 1;
                    jNext += 1;
                    break;
            }

            //If the next "space" is off the board, don't check it.
            if (iNext &lt; 0 || iNext &gt;= 3 || jNext &lt; 0 || jNext &gt;= 3) { break; }

            //If the next space has a matching letter...
            if (Board[iNext, jNext].Style == currentPiece.Style)
            {
                //Add this space to the collection of winning spaces.
                winningMoves.Add($"{iNext},{jNext}");
                inARow++;
            }
            else //Otherwise, no tic-tac-toe is found for this space/direction
            {
                return null;
            }
        }

        //If we found three in a row
        if (inARow >= 3)
        {
            //Return this set of spaces as the winning set
            winningMoves.Add($"{i},{j}");

            return new WinningPlay()
            {
                WinningMoves = winningMoves,
                WinningStyle = currentPiece.Style,
                WinningDirection = dir,
            };
        }

        //If we got here, we didn't find any tic-tac-toes for the given space.
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    However, that method only evaluates for a single space; now we need a method to do that for all spaces.
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    public WinningPlay GetWinner()
    {
        WinningPlay winningPlay = null;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++)
            {
                foreach (EvaluationDirection evalDirection in (EvaluationDirection[])Enum.GetValues(typeof(EvaluationDirection)))
                {
                    winningPlay = EvaluatePieceForWinner(i, j, evalDirection);
                    if (winningPlay != null) { return winningPlay; }
                }
            }
        }

        return winningPlay;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Extras</h3>

<p>
    Finally, let's implement two more methods: one which gets a message to 
    display the user when the game is won or drawn, and one to check for those 
    situations so we can display the message.
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    public string GetGameCompleteMessage()
    {
        var winningPlay = GetWinner();
        return winningPlay != null ? $"{winningPlay.WinningStyle} Wins!" : "Draw!";
    }

    public bool IsGamePieceAWinningPiece(int i, int j)
    {
        var winningPlay = GetWinner();
        return winningPlay?.WinningMoves?.Contains($"{i},{j}") ?? false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    With all of that, our GameBoard class is complete! Now we just need to use it
    on a razor component. Below is a basic razor component (which is what Blazor
    calls the .razor files) that we will modify to host our tic-tac-toe game.
</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">@@page "/tictactoe"
@@using BlazorGames.Models.TicTacToe;

&lt;h1&gt;Tic Tac Toe&lt;/h1&gt;

@@code {
    GameBoard board = new GameBoard();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    First, let's write the markup for the game board itself:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">&lt;div class="tictactoe-board"&gt;
    @@for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
    {
        &lt;div class="tictacttoe-column"&gt;
            @@for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++)
            {
                int x = i;
                int y = j;
                &lt;div class="tictactoe-gamepiece
                         tictactoe-@@board.Board[i,j].Style.ToString().ToLower()" @@onclick="@@(() => board.PieceClicked(x,y))"
                     style="@@(board.IsGamePieceAWinningPiece(i, j)? "opacity: 0.6" : "")"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
    Note that the div with class "tictactoe-gamepiece" has styles dynamically applied to it when 
    it is occupied by a letter and when it is part of the winning tic-tac-toe.
</p>

<p>
    The last little piece is to output a message for wins and draws.
</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">@@if (!board.GameComplete)
{
    &lt;h2&gt;@@board.CurrentTurn's Turn!&lt;/h2&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;h2&gt;
        @@board.GetGameCompleteMessage()
        &lt;button class="btn btn-success" @@onclick="@@(() => board.Reset())"&gt;
            Reset
        &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    And with that, we have a working tic-tac-toe game written in C# and Blazor WebAssembly!
